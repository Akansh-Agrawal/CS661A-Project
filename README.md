# 1 Introduction :

Visualizing air pollution data helps in the exploration of trends in air pollution
levels across various regions and time periods. It will help in identifying the
cause of high air pollution in certain highly polluted areas. Visualization of
rainfall patterns can be used to understand the impact of rainfall on agriculture
and other sectors which are highly dependent on rainfall. These two factors
help in developing the strategies for fighting against drought, excess rainfall
and climate changes by suitable prediction and statistical analysis of data .

# 2 Data Description :

The dataset for Air Pollution [4] [1] contains details about air pollutants
(Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), particulate matter less than
10 micrometers in diameter (PM10), and particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers
in diameter (PM2.5) monitored by the different stations. The data
includes information on the location of each station. The dataset also includes
information on the time period during which the measurements were taken,
with data available from as early as 2015 and up to 2020. This allows for the
analysis of air quality trends over time. The dataset for Rainfall [2] [3] sourced
from India Meteorological Department includes information on the amount of
rainfall received by each district in millimeters (mm) for the distinct months
over the past decade and so. Moreover, the vast dataset would be aggregated by
combining the various datasets available in the references mentioned.

# 3 Detailed Description of the Tasks :

1) We will begin by applying various preprocessing techniques to the dataset.
This will involve applying machine learning techniques to address issues such as
missing features, interpolation, and other data cleaning tasks.
2) Once the dataset has been preprocessed, we can display the rainfall and air
pollution data for various regions using visualization tools. The idea is to make
a web-based/standalone visualisation system providing the basic interaction entities.
3) The visualisation of dataset will also be followed by the prediction/forecasting
of air pollution and rainfall patterns in the various regions using various statistical
modelling techniques.
